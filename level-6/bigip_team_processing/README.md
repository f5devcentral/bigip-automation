# Overview
Service Owner teams are responsible for creating and maintaining their Services in NetOrca. This is covered in [BIGIP_TEAM](../bigip_team/README.md).<br>
Another responsibility of Service Owners is to process requests submitted by customers. Service Owners need to establish a workflow for processing Change Instances that come in to their queue.





## Definitions
- **Service** is well-defined piece of infrastructure that Service Owner Team offers to the Customers. Service Owner team defines the Service in a form of JsonSchema and is responsible for further processing of the infrastructure implementation. Examples: Web Server, Load Balancer, Firewall, etc.
- **Service Item** is an instance of a Service that is requested by a Customer. It is described by a Service Item name and a set of parameters defined in the Service JsonSchema. Service Item stores an actual state of Customer request.
- **Change Instance** is a change that is applied to a Service Item by a Customer. Customer can generate CREATE, MODIFY or DELETE Change Instances. Change Instances are reviewed and APPROVED/REJECTED/COMPLETED by Service Owner. APPROVED Change instances are processed by Service Owner team and effectively implemented as pieces of infrastructure.


## Processing Change Instances
Change Instances are processed by Service Owner team according to the workflow defined by them. NetOrca workflow is implemented as a series of state transitions of Change Instances. 
Changes can be processed manually (via GUI) or programatically (via API). It's up to Service Owner how processing of the Change Instances will be implemented. We highly encourage using automation-first approach and implementing processing of the Change Instances with API. This streamlines the workflow and makes it more reliable and easier to manage.

### Service Owners - General Processing of Changes

Customer requested changes will be published on NetOrca in the form of Change Instances for the particular service.

There are two stages which need to be processed, one is an optional second level validation stage. In this stage the Service Owner can take the Consumers Change Instance tickets and validate them as required before approving them. This validation could be an automated check of an external or related resource, or it could be a simple approval.

#### Validation Stage

The process for automating this validation would be performed by any automation script such as ansible or a third party tool. The basic operation is as follows:

The general processing of these changes will be the following:

1. Service Owner team gets the PENDING changes from the NetOrca API
2. Service Owner playbook validates the changes
3. If valid the changes are marked as APPROVED

#### Deployment Stage

![level-6-change-submission](../../images/levl6_so_ChangeProcessing.gif)

The general processing of these changes will be the following:

1. Service Owner team gets the APPROVED changes from the NetOrca API
2. Service Owner playbook extracts the Consumer ServiceItem declarations and converts them into AS3.
3. The AS3 is submitted to the BigIP devices
4. If successfully submitted the ChangeInstance is marked as COMPLETED.

This general process works for CREATE, DELETE and MODIFICATION of ServiceItems and can be completed imperatively or declaratively. 

## Change Instance state Lifecycle
Change Instance Lifecycle is as follows:
- **PENDING** - Change Instance is created and waits for approval/validation by Service Owner.
- **PENDING -> APPROVED** - Change Instance is approved by Service Owner
- **PENDING -> REJECTED** - Change Instance is rejected by Service Owner because of some validation/compliance issues.

<br>

- **APPROVED** - Change Instance is approved by Service Owner and is ready for deployment/implementation in the infrastructure.
- **APPROVED -> COMPLETED** - Change Instance is deployed into the infrastructure and completed.
- **APPROVED -> ERROR** - Change Instance is not deployed due to some error.

## Workflow scenarios

### Step 1. Customer submits a brand new Service Item

> This step is already covered in [CUSTOMER_A](../customer_a/README.md) and [CUSTOMER_B](../customer_b/README.md)


### Step 2. Service Owner reviews Change Instance generated by Customer request
> This step takes Change Instance state from PENDING to APPROVED, or PENDING to REJECTED.
> Depends on the Service configuration, newly created Change Instance can be automatically approved or requires manual approval.

#### Step 2.1. Change Instance is APPROVED

APPROVED is the ready to deploy state for that Change Instance. 

There are multiple configurable options for approval including:
- PreApproved changes
- Approval via GUI
- Approval via API

These are covered in detail in the NetOrca docs.

### Step 3. Change Instance is deployed
> This step takes Change Instance state from APPROVED to COMPLETED.
> This is the most important step in the workflow as it effectively implements the Customer request.
> Process is usually automated with some orchestration tool like Ansible or Terraform and is solely managed by Service Owner team.
> Goal of this step is to:
> * fetch all Change Instances that are in APPROVED state for Service X
> * do some custom logic (if needed) like filter by environment or other parameters
> * extract declarations from Service Items linked to Change Instances
> * translate declarations into format that is supported by the infrastructure (for example BIG-IP AS3 declaration), add custom logic (if needed) like splitting into multiple partitions, adding custom objects, requesting objects in external systems etc.
> * deploy it onto the F5 infrastructure and/or other external systems if needed
> * mark Change Instances as COMPLETED if automation run is successful


#### Step 3.1. Change Instances are automatically deployed with Ansible

In this demo we have set up two Ansible plays that will both validate (move to APPROVED) and deploy (move to COMPLETED) any customer Service Items to a lab F5

These are located here:
[VALIDATION play](https://awx.netorca.io/#/templates/job_template/41/details)

When you run this play you should see any PENDING change Instances for the LOAD_BALANCER service move to APPROVED

[DEPLOYMENT play](https://awx.netorca.io/#/templates/job_template/42/details)

When you run this play you should see any APPROVED Change Instances for the LOAD_BALANCER service move to COMPLETED. You will also see these load-balancers being deployed onto the lab F5 infrastructure. 

#### Step 3.2. Change Instances are automatically deployed with Terraform

#### Step 3.3. Change Instances are deployed manually
> Some NetOrca Services may require manual deployment of the infrastructure. For example fragile production environment cannot be automated because safety reasons.
> You can still accept requests via NetOrca for such scenarios to have a powerful audit trail and visibility into customer requests.
