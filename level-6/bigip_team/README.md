# Overview
Service Owners are responsible for creating and maintaining Service definitions that they offer via NetOrca.<br>
Services are defined in JsonSchema format which are then stored in GitLab repository.<br>
All changes to the Service definitions are done via GitLab repository and submitted to NetOrca via CICD pipeline.


### Service Owners - Schema Updates

The Service Owner workflow for updating Schemas is:

1. Make required schema changes within GitRepo
2. Create merge request to main, build will run validation check and report any issues
3. Merge, build will submit updated schema to NetOrca

## Service Owner flow
### Step 1. Create Service definition in JsonSchema format

```md

{
    "$id": "https://example.com/service.schema.json",
    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
    "type": "object",
    "title": "LOAD_BALANCER",                                       # <---- `title` is unique identifier of the Service in NetOrca
    "metadata": {                                                   #<---- one of NetOrca features is Charging API

        "type": "string",
        "pattern": "^([a-z]{1}[a-z0-9-]{1,60})$",                   #<---- jsonschema offers powerful validation capabilities like enums, regex, lists, objects in objects etc
        "examples": [
          "app01",
          "webserver01"
        ]

        ]
      },
      "virtual_server": {
        "type": "object",
        "required": ["ip", "port"],
        "properties": {
          "ip": {
            "type": "string",

            "examples": [

            "type": "integer",
            "examples": [
              80,
              443
            ]
          }
        }
      },
      "members": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
          "type": "object",
          "required": ["ip", "port"],
          "properties": {
            "ip": {
              "type": "string",
              "pattern": "^((25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\\.){3}(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)$",
              "examples": [

              ]
            },
            "port": {
              "type": "integer",
              "examples": [
                30880,
                30881
              ]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "name",
      "partition",
      "location",
      "type",
      "virtual_server",
      "members"
    ],
    "description": "New load balancer on F5 BigIP"
  }


```


### Step 2. Create README.md file with explanation of the Service and example usage

```md
# Load Balancer Service

BigIP Load Balancer service


### Schema Fields

- **name**: The name of the load balancer (string).
  - Must follow the pattern `^([a-z]{1}[a-z0-9-]{1,60})$`.
  - Examples: `app01`, `webserver01`.
  
- **partition**: The environment in which the load balancer resides.
  - Enum: `prod`, `dev`, `sit`, `uat`, `qa`.
  
- **location**: The network location, such as `dmz` or `internal`.
  
- **type**: The protocol type of the load balancer.
  - Enum: `http`, `https`, `tcp`.

- **virtual_server**: The IP and port of the load balancerâ€™s virtual server.
  - Fields:
    - `ip`: IPv4 address of the virtual server.
    - `port`: Port number for the virtual server.

- **members**: A list of IP addresses and ports for backend servers (array).
  - Each member has:
    - `ip`: IPv4 address of the backend server.
    - `port`: Port number for the backend server.


## Example Usage

The following is an example configuration in YAML format that aligns with the JSON schema.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
---

application1:
  services:
    LOAD_BALANCER:
      - name: load_balancer1
        partition: prod
        location: dmz
        comments: This is a new web server for testing
        type: http
        virtual_server:
          ip: 10.1.10.152
          port: 80
        members:
        - ip: 10.1.20.21
          port: 30880
```


### Step 3. Create a Merge Request with the changes, merge to main branch

> - after merge to main branch, CICD pipeline will be triggered and new Service will be available in NetOrca
> - check the Service in NetOrca Service Catalog

![step-3](../../images/netorca_demo_service_owner.gif)


### Step 4. Modify required Service settings in NetOrca GUI

> - NetOrca gives ability to control behaviour of the Service and Service Items with the following settings:
> - "Approval Required" - by default new Change Instances are preapproved, but Service Owner can change it to manually (or automatically) approve Change Instances
>   * useful in cases where Service Owner needs to do some validations in external services before approving changes
> - "Enable email notifications" - Service Owner will be notified about new Change Instances
> - "Allow Manual Approval" - Service Owner can approve/reject Change Instances in NetOrca GUI
> - "Allow Manual Completion" - Service Owner can complete Change Instances in NetOrca GUI
> - "Minimum Schema Version" - Service Owner can set minimum schema version that Customer can request
>   * Services can be upgraded, this feature allows backward compatibility for already existing Service Items

![step-4](../../images/level6_demo_service_owner_settings.png)


### Step 5. Get familiar with ADVANCED FEATURES (Versioning, Backward Compatibility, Service Configs, Allowed Teams, Dependant Teams)

> - NetOrca offers a powerful set of features to manage and configure services.
> - Some of the key features include:
>   - Versioning: Each service can have multiple versions, allowing for easy rollback or comparison of changes.
>   - Backward Compatibility: NetOrca ensures that new versions of a service are compatible with older versions, preventing breaking changes.
>   - Service Configs: Services can have multiple configurations, allowing for customization based on different environments or requirements.
>   - Allowed Teams: Services can be restricted to specific teams, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access or modify them.
>   - Dependant Teams: Services can have dependant teams, meaning that changes to the service will also trigger changes in the dependant teams.
