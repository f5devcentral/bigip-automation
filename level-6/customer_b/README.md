# Overview

This guide provides a overview of how to submit changes via NetOrca GUI.<br>

This is useful for teams that either do not require the level of auditing and collaboration that is offered via the Git repo, or may not be comfortable using Git currently. <br>
To accomplish this we will use the NetOrca Submission Builder.<br>

## Submission Builder workflow

### Go to Submission Builder and follow the instructions provided by the GUI.
